# Overview

You can now view your alerts from SCOM, Zabbix and Nagios in the unified alerts experience. These alerts come from integrations with Nagios/Zabbix servers or SCOM into Log Analytics. 

## Prerequisites
Any records in the Log Analytics repository with a type of Alert will get imported into the unified alerts experience, so you must perform whatever configuration is required to collect these records.
1. For **Nagios** and **Zabbix** alerts, [configure those servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-linux-agents) to send alerts to Log Analytics.
1. For **System Center Operations Manager** alerts, [connect your Operations Manager management group to your Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-om-agents). Any alerts created in System Center Operations Manager are imported into Log Analytics.

Once you have configured the import into Log Analytics, you’re good to go and can start viewing fired alerts from these sources in the unified alerts experience.

**Note**: Nagios alerts in the unified alerts experience are not stateful – a “fired” alert instance will not be changed to “resolved”. Instead, both the “fired” and “resolved” are displayed as separate alert instances.
