# Overview
This article shows you how to manage your alert instances across Azure, and how to get the contextual information that will help you manage the alert.
1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Monitor** and under the MONITOR section - choose **Alerts**.

1.	You will land on the **Alerts Summary** page, which gives you an overview of all your alert instances across Azure. You can modify the summary view by selecting **multiple subscriptions** (a maximum of 5) or by filtering across **resource groups**, specific **resources** or **time ranges**. Click on either Total Alerts or any of the severity bands to go to the list view for your alerts.

1.	You will land on the **All Alerts** page, where you will see all the alert instances across Azure listed out. If youâ€™re coming to the portal from an alert notification, you can use the filters available to narrow in on that specific alert instance. (**Note**: if you came to the page by clicking on any of the severity bands, the list will be pre-filtered for that severity when you land).
