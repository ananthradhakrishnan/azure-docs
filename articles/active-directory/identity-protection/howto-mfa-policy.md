# How To: Configure the multi-factor authentication registration policy

Azure AD Identity Protection helps you manage the roll-out of multi-factor authentication (MFA) registration by configuring a policy. This article explains what the policy can be used for an how to configure it.

## What is the multi-factor authentication registration policy?

Azure multi-factor authentication is a method of verifying who you are that requires the use of more than just a username and password. It provides a second layer of security to user sign-ins and transactions.  
We recommend that you require Azure multi-factor authentication for user sign-ins because it:

* Delivers strong authentication with a range of easy verification options
* Plays a key role in preparing your organization to protect and recover from account compromises
